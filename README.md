## The base for this code is from https://github.com/janbodnar/Java-Snake-Game

## Our mods are as follows: 

### Possible mods
* Levels
   * Maze levels (figure out how to make a wall - something that stops movement, figure out how to draw the wall visually via the pixels, design a maze)
   - Grace
   - Stanley
   * Snake needs to eat 10 apples per level to go on to the next level (make a counter, that increments when the snake eats an apple, call 'yay you passed' screen, and move to the next level) -> responsible for the counter & yay you passed screen.
   - Rosa
   - Ami
   * Moving to a new level.  (Call class for new level, not sure what else)
   - Anisah
   * Good apples/ bad apples (bad apples kill you - avoid it, they appear randomly, up to james for aditional functionality and interpretation)
   - James
   * Extra lives (maybe 3?) implementing extra lives. (counter, way to display those lives - work with Maria on 2nd part)  
   - Aven
   * snake is being chased by a mongoose must drop traps to make it go away. (mongoose must move to square with traps) (functionality: make traps, make a key the user presses to drop traps, create a mongoose creature that moves, make snake die if on the same square as mongoose, make mongoose die if on the same square as trap, give mongoose simple hard-coded rules for movement twards snake)
   - Jeffery
   - Osman

   * Lava level (spots on screen kill you, right now only edges kill you) - figure out how to draw lava spots on screen, figure out how to make lava spots kill you like the edges.  (put in same room as maze group)
   - Veliana
   - Jastine
 
 
 * Hidden easter-egg level
 * Bonus add-on rounds upon completion
 * Easy/more advanced (choose level to start, they get harder as they go)
   
* Having score count - Alejandro implemented
   * Scoreboard (who has won what - top 10 scores) -> storage (grab score, have user enter a name, if greater than any of the top 10 scores, save to a file, and display at the end of the game)
   - Emmanuel
   - Muhamad 
   - Yahya 

* Timed rounds (timer at the top, snake dies if doesn't make it, figure out what the snake needs to do in that time)
- Mark
- Raphael
   * We could make it change colors depending on how many times its eaten a thing
   * change colors depending on how much time is left




* Snake should be faster on higher levels - Alejandro implemented a current speed.
* Graphics Upgrade - Maria
* Sound Effects - (done) Could expand more Alejandro
